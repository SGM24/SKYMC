# CloudControl
Midi tool set for the game Sky: Children of the light
This app is mainly focused on the musical side of the game.

Since godot for andorid at these moments lacks the ability of a midi output, we have to use Cloudrouter wich is the midi toolset for the game, It will take UDP packets from Cloudkeys and convert them into midi output and keyboard macro for easy music playing on PC
